I have 6+ years of consulting under my belt, and have been involved in a wide
range of technical topics, both in development and operations. If you're
looking for lead-dev / CTO-like level of skills, I can deliver.

Over the years I developed a strong ability to get up and running on
new/existing projects very quickly. Also, having products (and paying clients)
myself means I understand what drives a business and can often find solutions
that were not envisioned by other members of the project.

## My main interests right now

* Streamlining deployment pipelines. Compared to the usual deployment tooling,
  orchestration tools such as Kubernetes or Convox give you at least a 10x
velocity for deploying apps, for at least half of the cost.

* Hosting high traffic websites, and finding every way to reduce hosting bills
  with agressive caching (both HTTP and application-level), performance
improvement in the hosted apps (less time spent processing requests = less
servers needed), profiling and refactoring hot paths, and last but not least,
better usage of cloud providers.

* Development of Rails5 apps. Also interested in Next.js and React.

## Some examples of things I've done in the past

* Greenfield RubyOnRails projects (obviously), including real-time features,
  heavy frontend JavaScript work, database optimizations.

* Revamping AWS infrastructure for a company offering a SaaS, reducing AWS bill
from $15k to $2.5k. And at the same time, getting them a nice platform and
continuous integration system to build, test, deploy, and monitor their
services.

* Migrating large (and critical) RubyOnRails projects from Rails2.x/Ruby1.8 to
  Rails4.x/Ruby2.x (and then Rails 5.x), adding a strong test suite and CI
pipeline to ensure the main features were working with the new stack as we went
over the numerous changes required to upgrade.

* Setup of CI/CD systems.

* Setup of infrastructure provisioning with Puppet.

* Migrating applications to docker, and everything that goes with it.

* Writing tests, both as blackbox tests against legacy systems to prepare for a
migration, and unit/integration/system tests.

* Advising and implementing Single Sign On solutions.

* ElasticSearch interactions (indexing, aggregations, reporting).

I'm preferably working remotely, but for larger projects I will generally
travel to meet your team at the beginning of the contract. I can also work on
site if you're based in the region of Rennes, France.
