<p>I have 6+ years of consulting under my belt, and have been involved in a wide
range of technical topics, both in development and operations. If you&#39;re
looking for lead-dev / CTO-like level of skills, I can deliver.</p>
<p>Over the years I developed a strong ability to get up and running on
new/existing projects very quickly. Also, having products (and paying clients)
myself means I understand what drives a business and can often find solutions
that were not envisioned by other members of the project.</p>
<h2 id="my-main-interests-right-now">My main interests right now</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Streamlining deployment pipelines. Compared to the usual deployment tooling,
orchestration tools such as Kubernetes or Convox give you at least a 10x
velocity for deploying apps, for at least half of the cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Hosting high traffic websites, and finding every way to reduce hosting bills
with agressive caching (both HTTP and application-level), performance
improvement in the hosted apps (less time spent processing requests = less
servers needed), profiling and refactoring hot paths, and last but not least,
better usage of cloud providers.</p></li>
<li><p>Development of Rails5 apps. Also interested in Next.js and React.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-examples-of-things-i-39-ve-done-in-the-past">Some examples of things I&#39;ve done in the past</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Greenfield RubyOnRails projects (obviously), including real-time features,
heavy frontend JavaScript work, database optimizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Revamping AWS infrastructure for a company offering a SaaS, reducing AWS bill
from $15k to $2.5k. And at the same time, getting them a nice platform and
continuous integration system to build, test, deploy, and monitor their
services.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating large (and critical) RubyOnRails projects from Rails2.x/Ruby1.8 to
Rails4.x/Ruby2.x (and then Rails 5.x), adding a strong test suite and CI
pipeline to ensure the main features were working with the new stack as we went
over the numerous changes required to upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup of CI/CD systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup of infrastructure provisioning with Puppet.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating applications to docker, and everything that goes with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing tests, both as blackbox tests against legacy systems to prepare for a
migration, and unit/integration/system tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Advising and implementing Single Sign On solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>ElasticSearch interactions (indexing, aggregations, reporting).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m preferably working remotely, but for larger projects I will generally
travel to meet your team at the beginning of the contract. I can also work on
site if you&#39;re based in the region of Rennes, France.</p>      </div>
