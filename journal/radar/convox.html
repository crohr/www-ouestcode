<h1 id="convox">Convox</h1>
<p>Last update: 11 October 2018</p>
<p>If I look back at my last 15 years of programming, there were a few things that
got me pretty excited, and for a few of them changed my career (dates are when
I discovered them):</p>
<ul>
<li>~1998 <strong>Internet</strong></li>
<li>~2000 <strong>HTML &amp; JavaScript</strong></li>
<li>~2006 jQuery</li>
<li>~2006 <strong>Rails 1.x</strong> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY&amp;feature=youtu.be">Build a Blog in 15 minutes</a> screencast</li>
<li>~2008 RESTful APIs</li>
<li>~2008 Puppet</li>
<li>~2013 <strong>Docker</strong></li>
<li>~2016 Convox</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://convox.com">Convox</a> is the latest thing in that list that blows my
mind. It&#39;s basically your own Heroku, built only with AWS primitives, and
incredibly powerful and cheap to run. I&#39;ve been following it since 2016, and
after they switched over to the second generation of their tool (ALB
integration) I built a few production clusters with it and couldn&#39;t be happier.</p>
<p>If you really like Heroku but it&#39;s too expensive for you, or if you really like
Kubernetes but the learning curve is too steep, then you should give Convox a try.</p>
<p>You get everything I always dreamed of, perfectly integrated around a single CLI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster (a &quot;rack&quot; in convox parlance) autoinstalls in minutes. You just need to provide AWS credentials.</li>
<li>Can be installed in your own AWS account, completely for free, and without any interactions with the official convox Console.</li>
<li>Deploy an app from your local directory. The local dir is tarball&#39;ed, uploaded, and the docker image is built on EC2 so that you&#39;re not dependent on your ISP bandwidth.</li>
<li>All your apps can be made highly available since they&#39;re all behind a load balancer.</li>
<li>A single ALB (Application Load Balancer) for all your apps, saving huge amounts of $$$.</li>
<li>Inspect running processes, and scale them up or down in seconds.</li>
<li>Easy (and secure) way to configure apps through env variables.</li>
<li>Rolling restarts.</li>
<li>Integrated health checks.</li>
<li>Integrated auto-scaling policies.</li>
<li>Exec into a running container right from your machine.</li>
<li>SSH into a running EC2 instance right from your machine.</li>
<li>Centralized logs, and easy tailing.</li>
<li>Automatic SSL certificate generation.</li>
<li>Create AWS resources (mysql, postgres, s3, etc.) right from the command line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost: ~$70/m for a rack with 3 t3.medium machines (spot enabled) that can host
apps for a total of 12GB RAM.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to believe, but with Convox the hardest thing to do to deploy an app
right now is building the Dockerfile, which is basically Computing 101 nowadays.</p>
<p>No more terraform, puppet/ansible/salt/etc., capistrano, shell scripts. You can
deploy a rack full of machines and deploy your first app in half a day. And
then 10 more apps the following afternoon, it is that powerful.</p>
<p>Other niceties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built by 3 early heroku employees, including the awesome @ddollar.</li>
<li>Private networking is supported, if you need NAT gateways.</li>
<li>EFS support included, so you can share files across multiple instances of the same process.</li>
<li>You can enable spot instance bidding for massive savings.</li>
<li>OpenSource.</li>
<li>In active development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you need raw TCP connections for your web services, you may use gen1 apps,
but I would just deploy them in another way. Convox really shines with
HTTP(/2) apps.</li>
<li>it doesn&#39;t have the same traction as Kubernetes, and is dependent on AWS.</li>
