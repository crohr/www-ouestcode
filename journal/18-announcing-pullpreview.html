<h1 id="announcing-pullpreview">Announcing PullPreview</h1>
<p>Ever wanted to easily preview a branch or pull request on GitHub? Check out my latest product: <a href="https://pullpreview.com">PullPreview.com</a></p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="on-demand-preview-environments">On demand preview environments</h3>
<p>From your project, just click on any pull request, branch, or tag to start a live environment based on your <code>docker-compose.pullpreview.yml</code> file. You&#39;ll get a custom URL that you can share with anyone wanting to have a look at the app or a new feature.</p><h3 id="auto-deploy-pull-requests-and-branches">Auto-deploy pull requests and branches</h3><p>Manually starting sessions from any reference is nice, but what&#39;s better is to automatically deploy new commits as they come for a pull request or branch. Enabling auto-deploy will make sure your preview environment is always up to date with the latest changes.</p><p>By default, and to save on credits, auto-deployed environments will be shut down after 72h, unless a new commit is pushed. You can also manually wake up an auto-deploy environment that went asleep from the UI.</p><p>When a branch or pull request is deleted, any auto-deploy environment associated with it will be automatically shut down, ending the credits consumption.</p><h3 id="expose-any-port">Expose any port</h3><p>Contrary to a lot of other platforms, you are not limited to only 1 publicly-exposed port. Any process declared in your docker-compose file can expose any number of ports (as long as they don&#39;t conflict). You will get a dedicated IP for each deployment.</p><h3 id="persistent-volumes">Persistent volumes</h3><p>Want to keep demo data around across redeploys? Just define volumes in your docker-compose file and we&#39;ll take care of persisting them, and reattaching them for your next deploys. For instance, you can easily keep a persistent postgres/mysql database with demo data for the same branch or pull request, across deployments.</p><h3 id="simple-credit-system">Simple credit system</h3><p>Each plan comes with a dedicated number of credits. A one-hour preview session costs 1 credit (each hour started is due). On the free plan you will get 50 credits/month. The first paid plan starts at $50, for 750 credits/month (equivalent to 1 session running without interruption for 1 month). With auto-deploy jobs automatically going asleep or ending when the branch or pull request is closed, you should be able to run a lot of auto-deploy sessions on that plan. A common use case is to enable auto-deploy for your main branch (e.g. <code>master</code>), and for any pull request that requires thorough end-to-end testing and/or approval by a product manager.</p>      </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="footer">	<hr/>	<p>	  <a href="mailto:contact@codelicacy.com">contact@codelicacy.com</a>	  -
