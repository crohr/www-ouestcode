OuestCode is a software development and operations company based in Rennes
(FR), and run by [Cyril Rohr][about].

You can have a look at my [products][products], which are all at the
intersection of the Dev and Ops domain (packaging, on-demand review, etc).

If you're looking for short-term help on your own projects, I also offer
[consultancy services][consulting], mainly for **Ruby on Rails** apps, and
DevOps-related stuff: DEB/RPM **Packaging**, **Docker**, **Cloud Platforms**
(AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku), Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery, etc.

I can also offer training sessions on the aforementioned subjects. I also enjoy
teaching to people from non-IT domains (e.g. Sketch'Up Ruby API for architects).
