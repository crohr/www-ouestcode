OuestCode is a software development and operations company based in Brittany,
close to the French west coast, and run by [Cyril Rohr][about].

At OuestCode I develop and sell my own [products][products], which are all at the
intersection of the Dev and Ops domain (packaging, on-demand review, etc).

If you're looking for short-term help on your own projects, I also offer
[consultancy services][consulting], mainly for **Ruby on Rails** apps, and DevOps-related stuff:
DEB/RPM **Packaging**, **Docker**, **Cloud Platforms** (AWS, Google Cloud,
Heroku), Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery, etc.

I can also offer training sessions on the aforementioned subjects, especially
if it involves people from non-IT domains (e.g. Sketch'Up Ruby API workshop for
Technical Building Drawers).
