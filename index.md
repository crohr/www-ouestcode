<p>OKCoded is a company that creates sound IT products.</p>
<p>Currently a team of 1, I strive to create useful and simple <a href="/products">products</a> at the intersection of the Dev and Ops domain. For instance <a href="http://chunk.io">chunk.io</a>, <a href="https://packager.io">packager.io</a>, <a href="http://buildcurl.com">buildcurl.com</a>, <a href="https://packagehall.com">packagehall.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you're looking for short-term help on your own projects, I also offer <a href="/consulting">consultancy services</a> (mainly for Ruby on Rails apps, and DevOps-related stuff: DEB/RPM Packaging, Docker, AWS, Continuous Delivery, etc.)</p>
