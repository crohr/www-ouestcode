<p>OuestCode is a company that creates sound IT products. Based in Brittany, on
the French west coast.</p>

<p>Currently a <a href="/about">team of 1</a>, I strive to create useful and simple
<a href="/#products">products</a> at the intersection of the Dev and Ops domain.</p>

<p>If you're looking for short-term help on your own projects, I also offer
<a href="/#consulting">consultancy services</a>, mainly for <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> apps, and DevOps-related stuff:
DEB/RPM <strong>Packaging</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>Cloud Platforms</strong> (AWS, Google Cloud,
Heroku), Continuous Integration &amp; Continuous Delivery, etc.</p>

<h2>Consulting</h2>

<p>Over the years I believe I developed a strong ability to get up and running on
new/existing projects very fast. Also, having products (and paying clients)
myself means I understand what drives a business and can often find solutions
that were not envisioned by other members of the project.</p>

<p>Examples of things I've done in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Revamping AWS infrastructure for a company offering a SaaS, reducing AWS bill
from $15k to $2.5k. And at the same time, getting them a nice platform and
continuous integration system to build, test, deploy, and monitor their
services.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating a large (and critical) RubyOnRails project from Rails2.x/Ruby1.8 to
Rails4.x/Ruby2.x, adding a strong test suite and CI pipeline to ensure the main
features were working with the new stack as we went over the numerous changes
required to upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup of CI/CD systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup of infrastructure provisioning with Puppet.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating applications to docker, and everything that goes with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing tests, both as blackbox tests against legacy systems to prepare for a
migration, and unit/integration/system tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Advising and implementing Single Sign On solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>ElasticSearch interactions (indexing, aggregations, reporting).</p></li>
<li><p>Greenfield RubyOnRails projects (obviously).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm preferably working remotely, but for larger projects I will generally
travel to meet your team at the beginning of the contract. I can also work on
site if you're based in the region of Rennes, France.</p>
