Over the years I believe I developed a strong ability to get up and running on
new/existing projects very fast. Also, having products (and paying clients)
myself means I understand what drives a business and can often find solutions
that were not envisioned by other members of the project.

Examples of things I've done in the past:

* Revamping AWS infrastructure for a company offering a SaaS, reducing AWS bill
from $15k to $2.5k. And at the same time, getting them a nice platform and
continuous integration system to build, test, deploy, and monitor their
services.

* Migrating a large (and critical) RubyOnRails project from Rails2.x/Ruby1.8 to
Rails4.x/Ruby2.x, adding a strong test suite and CI pipeline to ensure the main
features were working with the new stack as we went over the numerous changes
required to upgrade.

* Setup of CI/CD systems.

* Setup of infrastructure provisioning with Puppet.

* Migrating applications to docker, and everything that goes with it.

* Writing tests, both as blackbox tests against legacy systems to prepare for a
migration, and unit/integration/system tests.

* Advising and implementing Single Sign On solutions.

* ElasticSearch interactions (indexing, aggregations, reporting).

* Greenfield RubyOnRails projects (obviously).

I'm preferably working remotely, but for larger projects I will generally
travel to meet your team at the beginning of the contract. I can also work on
site if you're based in the region of Rennes, France.
